### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Linting

Run `npm run lint` to execute the linting checks on the project.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### CI/CD Pipeline

This project includes a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions. The pipeline:

1. Runs linting checks on the codebase
2. Builds the Angular application for production
3. Deploys the built application to a VPS via SSH (only on main/master branch)

#### GitHub Secrets Setup for Deployment

To enable the automatic deployment to your VPS, you need to set up the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

1. `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`: Your private SSH key for accessing the VPS
2. `SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS`: The SSH known hosts entry for your VPS
3. `SSH_USER`: The username for SSH login to your VPS
4. `SSH_HOST`: The hostname or IP address of your VPS
5. `DEPLOY_PATH`: The path on your VPS where the application should be deployed

For detailed instructions on setting up SSH keys for deployment, see the [SSH Setup Guide](./docs/ssh-setup-guide.md).

### Troubleshooting

#### Package Version Issues

If you encounter npm package version issues during installation or CI/CD:

1. Make sure all Angular package versions are aligned (all should use the same major.minor version)
2. Create or update `.npmrc` file with:
   ```
   registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
   legacy-peer-deps=true
   ```
3. Try clearing npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
4. Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then run `npm install`

#### CI/CD Deployment Issues

If deployment fails:

1. Verify SSH keys are correctly set up in GitHub Secrets
2. Check that the target directory on the VPS exists and has correct permissions
3. Ensure the SSH user has write permissions to the deploy path
4. Test the SSH connection locally: `ssh <ssh_user>@<ssh_host>`
